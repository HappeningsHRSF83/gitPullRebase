/*  Jest is really FREAKING AWESOME because it comes with everything 
packaged together. This means no more extra libraries for testing. Jest
also allows for both front-end (only React though I believe) and 
back-end testing. Really makes writing unit tests for your particular
feature easy!

Refer below for writing correct tests:

1. Create a new section for your tests using comments 
  (ex: //Tests for Artist Component & Artist List Component)

2. Write 5 tests that pertain to only YOUR ticket 

3. Don't worry about other people's tests that are already in here, just 
keep adding yours to the top
